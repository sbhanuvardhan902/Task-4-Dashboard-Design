# Task-4-Dashboard-Design
Design an engaging dashboard in Power BI or Tableau to help stakeholders track key metrics like sales, profit, and growth. Make it interactive with filters, show trends over time, highlight key stats with summary cards, use a clean color theme, and add easy navigation if possible.
Finance Report Dashboard

I created this Finance Dashboard in Power BI using the sample financial dataset provided by Microsoft.

Objective
The goal was to build a dashboard that highlights key financial insights, helping stakeholders make smart, data-driven decisions.

Whatâ€™s Inside the Report
The dashboard includes several interactive sections:

You can filter the data by Segment, Country, and Year to focus on specific details.

Summary cards display key figures such as Total Units Sold, Total Gross Sales, and Total Profit.

A clustered bar chart visualizes quarterly profit trends by year.

An area chart shows how profit changes month by month.
